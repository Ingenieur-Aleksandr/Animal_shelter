# Animal_shelter
Prediction of animals destinies with an information about animals taken to the shelter

# Preamble
Thanks to SBER AI and Sirius University with their program "Deep learning in risk-managment" I have improved my skills in deep learning tasks, their resolving with pytorch framework. This repository contains my study concerned with an example task - animal shelter dataset analysis and animals destinies prediction

# Introduction
Sometimes animals (cats or dogs especially in huge cities) get lost. It is tragic. We need to predict their destiny with some characteristics to improve our conditions in shelters for animals to make them happier and to allow them to get new owners

# Work stages
Firstly, I have looked for insights in data. I have made some transformations, data cleaning. Then I have buit multilayer perceptron and trained it. Pytorch framework and custom data loader have been used to reach the goal.

# Results
68 of 100 accuracy - not bad result. Also you can take a look on my tensorboard.
